This is the python/cython implementation of the Polymer atmospheric correction
algorithm.
http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-19-10-9783



## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Python environment

Polymer is written in python. It requires the installation of a python environment with the
required dependencies.

#### 1.1.1 Pixi (recommended)

A python environment for Polymer can be installed with the [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) package
manager.

In the Polymer directory, run the following command to install and activate the environment:
```
pixi shell
```

Note: after Polymer update, pixi automatically updates the environment.

#### 1.1.2 Conda/mamba

The file `environment.yml` can be used to create a conda environment with Polymer dependencies:
```
conda env create -n polymer -f environment.yml
conda activate polymer
```

Note: after updating Polymer, it may be necessary to recreate this environment.

### 1.2 Auxiliary data

Two directories are necessary to store data files required by Polymer. These files are located
using environment variables - please define these variables where is appropriate in your system:

- A directory for storing static data files, `$DIR_POLYMER_AUXDATA`, or if this environment variable is not provided, in `auxdata` in the current directory.
- A directory for storing ancillary meteo files downloaded on the fly, `$DIR_POLYMER_ANCILLARY`, or if this environment variable is not provided, in `ANCILLARY` in the current directory.

Please define these variables (`$DIR_POLYMER_AUXDATA` and `$DIR_POLYMER_ANCILLARY`) to existing empty directories it in your `.bashrc` or in a `.env` file at the root of the Polymer repository.

```
DIR_POLYMER_AUXDATA=/path/to/polymer_auxdata/
DIR_POLYMER_ANCILLARY=/path/to/polymer_ancillary/
```
The auxiliary data can then be downloaded in this folder with the following command:
```
$ make auxdata
```


### 1.3 Compilation

The pyx files are cython files which need to be converted to C, then compiled.
A makefile is provided, so just type:
```
$ make
```

NOTE: the command `make all` will download the auxiliary files and proceed to the compilation.


## 2. Usage

Note: for version 5 preview, see README_v5.md

### 2.1 How to run the algorithm

There is a minimalistic command line interface `polymer_cli.py`
```
./polymer_cli.py <level1> <level2>
```

Where <level1> is a level1 file or directory for any of the supported sensors,
and <level2> is the result to be generated.

See `./polymer_cli.py -h` for more help


More options are available by running polymer directly from your own python script.

```python
from polymer.main import run_atm_corr
from polymer.level1 import Level1
from polymer.level2 import Level2
run_atm_corr(Level1('MER_RR__1PRACR20050501_092849_000026372036_00480_16566_0000.N1',
                    <other optional level1 arguments>),
                Level2('output.nc',
                    <other optional level2 arguments>),
                <optional polymer arguments>)
```

See `example.py` for more details...


**Multiprocessing**

One option is `multiprocessing`, which controls the number of threads available for Polymer processing (by default, multiprocessing is disactivated). To activate the processing on as many threads as there are cores on the CPU, pass the value `-1`:
```
run_atm_corr(..., multiprocessing=-1)
```

This option controls the parallelization of the core Polymer processing. However, Polymer relies on numpy, which can also use parallel processing, and results in a moderate usage of multiple cores. To also disactivate numpy multiprocessing, you can pass the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` (or use the [threadpoolctl](https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl) library)



### 2.2 Ancillary data

#### 2.2.1 NASA Ancillary data

The credentials for accessing NASA ancillary data should be provided in your ~/.netrc file:
```
cd ~
touch .netrc
echo "machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login uid_goes_here password password_goes_here" > .netrc
chmod 0600 .netrc
```

More information here: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/data_access/curl_and_wget

Ancillary data (ozone total column, wind speed, surface pressure) can be
provided to the level1 class through the class Ancillary_NASA (NASA files in
hdf4 format):

```python
    from polymer.ancillary import Ancillary_NASA
    Level1(<filename>, ancillary=Ancillary_NASA())
```

**NOTE**: the class `Ancillary_NASA` has default options to automatically download and select
the closest available dataset, in the folder `ANCILLARY/METEO/`

This folder is initialized with the command `make ancillary` or `make all`.

For more information about the optional parameters, please look at the help of
`Ancillary_NASA`.


#### 2.2.2 ERA Interim ancillary data

Optionnally, the ancillary data (ozone total column, wind speed, surface
pressure) can be provided by ECMWF's global reanalysis ERA-Interim.

See https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim

The following python modules are necessary to interface Polymer with ERA-Interim:
    * ecmwf python api client (to download ERA-Interim files on the fly)
      A ECMWF key is necessary.
      See https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets
    * pygrib, to read the ERA-Interim files in grib format.

The ERA-Interim ancillary data is used by passing the class Ancillary_ERA to
the parameter ancillary of the Level1.

```python
    from polymer.ancillary_era import Ancillary_ERA
    Level1(<filename>, ancillary=Ancillary_ERA())
```

By default, the closest data in time is automatically used, and downloaded on
the fly if necessary.
For more information, please look at the docstring of Ancillary_ERA.

#### 2.2.3 ERA5 ancillary data

The ancillary data can also be provided by ECMWF's ERA5 dataset:
https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5

The following python modules are required:
* cdsapi. A CDS API key is required.
  Please see https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to for more details.
* xarray

```python
    from polymer.ancillary_era5 import Ancillary_ERA5
    Level1(<filename>, ancillary=Ancillary_ERA5())
```

### 2.3 Input data

This section provides information about the supported file formats and sensors.

**NOTE**: The class `Level1` (`from polymer.level1 import Level1`) autodetects the file
format and returns the appropriate specific level1 object (Level1_MERIS, Level1_OLCI, etc).

#### 2.3.1 MERIS/Envisat

Both FF (reduced resolution) and FR (full resolution) are supported.

Example:
```python
from polymer.level1_meris import Level1_MERIS
Level1_MERIS('MER_RR__1PRACR20050501_092849_000026372036_00480_16566_0000.N1')
    # optional arguments: sline, eline, ancillary
```

#### 2.3.2 OLCI/Sentinel3

Both RR and FR are supported.
The name of the Level1 product is the name of the directory.

Example:
```python
from polymer.level1_olci import Level1_OLCI
Level1_OLCI('S3A_OL_1_EFR____20170123T102747_20170123T103047_20170124T155459_0179_013_279_2160_LN1_O_NT_002.SEN3')
    # optional arguments: sline, eline, scol, ecol, ancillary
```


#### 2.3.3 MODIS/Aqua, SeaWiFS, VIIRS

MODIS, SeaWiFS and VIIRS requires Level1C files as input.
See next section about Level 1C files for more information.

Example:
```python
from polymer.level1_nasa import *
Level1_MODIS('A2010120124000.L1C')
Level1_SeaWiFS('S2000116121145.L1C')
Level1_VIIRS('V2013339115400.L1C')
    # optional arguments: sline, eline, scol, ecol, ancillary
```


#### 2.3.4 MSI/Sentinel-2

The name of the level1 product refers to the path to the granule (in
the "GRANULE/" directory).

Example:

```python
from polymer.level1_msi import Level1_MSI
Level1_MSI('S2A_OPER_PRD_MSIL1C_PDMC_20160504T225644_R094_V20160504T105917_20160504T105917.SAFE/GRANULE/S2A_OPER_MSI_L1C_TL_SGS__20160504T163055_A004524_T30TXR_N02.02')
    # optional arguments: sline, eline, ancillary
```

#### 2.3.5 Ascii input

Polymer supports ascii (CSV) data input from multiple sensors through the level1 class Level1_ASCII.

#### 2.3.6 Subsetted products produced by SNAP

Level1_NETCDF can be used to read MERIS, OLCI or Sentinel2 products in
netCDF4 format, written by SNAP, in particular when used for subsetting.


### 2.4 Level 1C files

NASA OBPG L1A and L1B don't include all necessary radiometric corrections.
Thus it is necessary to apply `l2gen` with custom options to write the TOA
reflectances into what we call "Level1C" product.

The command line is typically:

```
l2gen ifile=<level1a> ofile=<level1c> gain="1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1" oformat="netcdf4" l2prod="rhot_nnn polcor_nnn sena senz sola solz latitude longitude"
```

See `tools/make_L1C.py`, which is a helper script to generate level 1c products.


### 2.5 Output

The output files can be in format hdf4 or netcdf.
They contain the water reflectance (dimensionless, fully-normalized for sun and
sensor at nadir) and other self-explanatory parameters.

### 2.6 Flagging

The Polymer flags are the following:

```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
```
Note: additional cloud masking using IdePix (https://github.com/bcdev/snap-idepix) is recommended.
